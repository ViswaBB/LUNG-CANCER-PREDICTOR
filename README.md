# LUNG-CANCER-PREDICTOR🫁 AI-Powered Lung Cancer Risk Prediction & Lifestyle Recommendation System Top 30 Finalist – Electrothon, Chennai Institute of Technology (2025)

An AI-powered tool for early lung cancer risk detection with personalized lifestyle suggestions using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

🔍 Overview This project combines Machine Learning and Generative AI to predict the risk level of lung cancer based on lifestyle and medical metrics, and provides personalized lifestyle recommendations using Gemini API (Google AI). It aims to assist doctors, caregivers, and patients with proactive cancer prevention strategies.

🎯 Key Features 🧠 Predicts lung cancer risk using a trained SVM model

📊 Input: Lifestyle + biomarker data (e.g., smoking habits, CA 19-9 levels, BMI, HIV status)

💬 Generates Gemini-based personalized lifestyle recommendations

📚 Maintains user-specific prediction history with insights over time

🔐 Lightweight authentication using username-based tracking

🔬 ML Model Details 📌 Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Type: Binary classification (Risk Level: 0 = Low, 1 = High)

Trained on: Synthetic + enriched healthcare dataset

Preprocessing: StandardScaler for normalization

Input Features:

Smoking, Alcohol, BMI, Age, HIV, CA19-9, Bilirubin, etc.

🤖 RAG with Gemini (Google AI) Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro (via Google Generative AI SDK)

Purpose:

Analyze risk level

Generate health advice using both current input and user history

Output: Tailored, human-like recommendations
